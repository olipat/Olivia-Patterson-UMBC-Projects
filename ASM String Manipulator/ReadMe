Project title: Assembly/C String Manipulator 
Tech stack: Assembly and C languages in a GL server which provided GCC, C compilation, and NASM for Assembly code
Project Technical Problem and Scope: This project was an exercise to tackle dynamic string manipulation and memory allocation, focusing on a user-friendly command-line interface for string operations including read, display, encrypt, and print stats. Assembly language was used for the core operations in the program and C was used for dynamic memory allocation and string manipulation. The user should be able to put in any size string as long it begins with a capital letter and ends with punctuation. The focus of this project was primarily on implementing core functionality, user interactions, and avoiding memory leaks, with less priority placed on extensive error checking. 
Reflection: Tackling my first project with Assembly and calling C functions was really tough, but I learned so much from it. It was all about getting the basics right and not worrying too much about checking for every possible mistake. This approach helped me greatly increase my confidence in Assembly language. It felt great to see myself grow and handle this challenge.
