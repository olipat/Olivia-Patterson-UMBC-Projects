Project title: Python File System

Tech stack: Python programming language in Pycharm by JetBrains

Project Technical Problem and Scope: This project aimed to simulate basic file system operations within a command-line interface using Python. The use of dictionaries and keys was necessary. The project focuses on creating a virtual environment that allows users to navigate through directories, create files and directories, and perform simple prompts to mimic real file system interactions within a closed environment. The basic operations included are ‘cd’, ‘mkdir’, ‘touch’, ‘ls’, ‘rm’, and ‘locate’. Basic error handling is included in the project. 

Reflection: This project was the final project in my first semester of computer science, a field I was new to. It was tough at the start, but I ended up very proud of what I made. After completing this project it became clear to me that this was my calling. I found immense joy in the critical thinking required to bring a project to life. The sense of achievement I felt with each successful outcome confirmed my passion for this field.
