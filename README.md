# Olivia-Patterson-UMBC-Projects
Hello, my name is Olivia Patterson and I'm a senior at University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Game Development. As an adult learner stepping into the realm of computer science, this field is somewhat new to me, but I quickly grew to love it. As I navigate through the intricacies of coding, algorithms, and software development, I've grown to appreciate the beauty of turning ideas into reality through programming. 
In my repository, you'll find each project comes with a README outlining the project technical problem and scope, tools used, and a reflection. Where applicable, I have provided makefiles and sample output. 
As I approach the culmination of my undergraduate journey, I am eager to apply the skills and knowledge I've acquired in a professional setting. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team and learning alongside experienced professionals in the field.
