# Olivia-Patterson-UMBC-Projects
Hello, my name is Olivia Patterson and I'm a senior at University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Game Development. As an adult learner stepping into the realm of computer science, this field is somewhat new to me, but I quickly grew to love it. As I navigate through the intricacies of coding, algorithms, and software development, I've grown to appreciate the beauty of turning ideas into reality through programming. 

In my repository, you'll find each project comes with a README outlining the project technical problem and scope, tools used, and a reflection. Where applicable, I have provided makefiles and sample output. 
Projects:
1. C++ Priority Queue- Implements and tests a C++ priority queue class for managing patient data
